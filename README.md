**Track Day** is a Django-based full-stack web application for motorsport enthusiasts to book and manage their track day experiences at popular UK circuits like Brands Hatch, Silverstone, and Lydden Hill. Users can choose available cars, time slots, and ride options (e.g. with/without instructor), and view or edit their bookings.

## User Experience (UX)

Track Day delivers a streamlined and adrenaline-pumping user experience for motorsport enthusiasts across the UK. The platform is built with intuitive navigation, a modern UI, and clear call-to-action prompts to guide users from track discovery to final booking. Whether you're a seasoned driver or a curious newcomer, Track Day offers detailed track insights, car rental options, and ride preferences to personalize the booking experience. The platform is fully responsive, making it effortless to explore and book track sessions on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Project Goals

The goal of the Track Day project is to provide users with a dynamic, accessible, and engaging platform for exploring and booking track driving experiences across the UK. The project is focused on simplifying the booking process while offering a wide range of track and ride options, complete with clear information and visuals. By centralizing availability, ride choices (with instructor, without instructor, passenger), and car rental selections, Track Day aims to elevate the motorsport experience into a user-friendly digital service.

### Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology was adopted to efficiently plan, execute, and iterate development for Track Day. A GitHub Project Board and a user story template were used throughout the project lifecycle.

Epics were defined to group user stories under broader goals (e.g., Booking Management, Track Discovery, User Authentication).
User Stories were written using the standard format:
As a [user], I can [action] so that [goal], with clear acceptance criteria.
The GitHub Project Board was made public to track progress in columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
Labels (such as Bug, Enhancement, Testing, Priority) were applied to issues for better visibility and prioritization.
Iterative development allowed continuous improvements based on testing feedback and alignment with the user journey.

The Track Day Booking website features a bold and sporty aesthetic that mirrors the excitement of motorsport. A dynamic and responsive design ensures users on all devices have a seamless experience. The homepage highlights three featured tracks with preview images and star icons to indicate popularity. A clean navigation bar allows users to easily access track listings, login/register, or return home. Track cards feature custom circuit illustrations and responsive hover effects for a modern UI. The booking forms are intuitive, styled with Bootstrap, and follow a consistent dark-on-light visual hierarchy. The footer is fixed, styled to complement the site's tone, and includes copyright info.

### Data Models

1. User Model
  
* Utilizes Django's built-in User model, enhanced with Django Allauth for authentication and account management.
* Each User can have multiple Bookings, establishing a one-to-many relationship between User and Booking.
2. Track Model
  
* Represents individual race tracks available for booking.
* Fields include name, description, location, and an image representing the track.
* Each Track can have multiple Bookings, but each Booking is associated with only one Track, forming a one-to-many relationship.
  
3. Car Model
* Represents cars available for rental during track days.
* Fields include make, model, year, and availability status.
* Each Car can be associated with multiple Bookings, but each Booking is linked to only one Car, establishing a one-to-many relationship.
  
4. Booking Model
* Central model that ties together Users, Tracks, and Cars.
* Fields include:
  * User (ForeignKey to User model)
  * Track (ForeignKey to Track model)
  * Car (ForeignKey to Car model)
  * Date of booking
  * Time slot
  * Ride option (e.g., with instructor, without instructor)
* Implements validation to prevent overlapping bookings for the same track and time slot.
* Provides full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete their bookings.
---
## Security Features

### User Authentication
* Implemented using Django Allauth, providing comprehensive features for user registration, login, logout, password reset, and email verification. ‚Äã

### Login Decorator
* Views such as booking_create, booking_success, booking_overview, edit_booking, and delete_booking are protected using Django's @login_required decorator.
* This ensures that only authenticated users can access booking-related functionalities.‚Äã

### CSRF Protection
* Django provides built-in protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
* CSRF tokens are generated per user session and are required for form submissions and state-changing actions.
* Upon user logout, the session and associated CSRF token are invalidated, mitigating the risk of forged requests.‚Äã

### Form Validation
* The booking_create view utilizes the BookingForm class to validate user input.
* Validation checks include ensuring selected date and time slots are available, and that all required fields are correctly filled.
* Custom validation logic prevents overlapping bookings by checking existing bookings for the selected track and time slot.‚Äã

### Custom error pages
* Custom 404 (Page Not Found) and 500 (Internal Server Error) pages are implemented to enhance user experience.
* These pages provide informative messages and a button to redirect users back to the homepage.‚Äã

* Click the "New" button at the top right corner and select "Create New App".
* Enter a unique application name
* Select your region
* Click "Create App"

#### Prepare enviroment and settings.py
* In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
* Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
* Update the settings.py file to import the env.py file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
* Comment out the default database configuration.
* Save all files and make migrations.
* Add the Cloudinary URL to env.py
